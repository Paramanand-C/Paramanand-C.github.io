## How To Apply for Student Projects

To apply write an email to paramanand.chandramouli@uni-siegen.de with the following details:
- Your study program, semester, and your current Masters/Bachelors transcripts
- Your experience in programming
- Research topic you are interested in
- Your experience in deep learning, image processing, computer vision- courses and projects.
  For projects in deep learning **prior experience** gained by completing relevant courses at University of Siegen is necessary.

Optional:
- your CV
- github page

I will then send you a small task related to deep learning, which you need to solve in a week. After you successfully solve this task, we have a meeting to discuss  about possible projects.
