## Abstract

> We propose a new technique in which line segments and elliptical arcs are used as features for recognizing image patterns. By using this approach, the process of locating a model in a given image is efficient since the number of features to be compared is few. We propose distance measures to evaluate the similarity between the features of the model and that of the image. The model transformation parameters are found by searching the transformation space using cell decomposition.
