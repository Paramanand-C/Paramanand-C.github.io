## Abstract

> Recently deep generative models have achieved impressive progress in modeling the distribution of training data. In this work, we present for the first time a generative model for 4D light field patches using variational autoencoders to capture the data distribution of light field patches. We develop a generative model conditioned on the central view of the light field and incorporate this as a prior in an energy minimization framework to address diverse light field reconstruction tasks. While pure learning-based approaches do achieve excellent results on each instance of such a problem, their applicability is limited to the specific observation model they have been trained on. On the contrary, our trained light field generative model can be incorporated as a prior into any model-based optimization approach and therefore extend to diverse reconstruction tasks including light field view synthesis, spatial-angular super resolution and reconstruction from coded projections. Our proposed method demonstrates good reconstruction, with performance approaching end-to-end trained networks, while outperforming traditional model-based approaches on both synthetic and real scenes. Furthermore, we show that our approach enables reliable light field recovery despite distortions in the input.
